This is the project for UCSD course CSE135: Server side web applications

Collaborators:

Overview:
All Custom java classes under src/
JSP files under WebContent/
text information support files under WebContent/txtdata

Implementation:
Kept same basic structure with all application data gradually
accumulating in the session object. Only major modifications are the
changes to use the database instead of vectors.

Every file using the database connects using a function defined in
a java class DBConnection.java.

JSP files were used to generate the inserts to the database from the
support vectors. All the sample data is now part of the
ApplicationSystem.sql file.

Phase 3 implementation:
Core application the same as before. Changed settings in the
server.xml file and web.xml to implement the access constraints.

New pages are the Login and login failure pages as well the
registration pages. request.sendRedirect is used to call the
registration form again if there is an error and the registration
form contains to logic to display the error messages.
